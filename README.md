# tedegraph
There are various formats, how to present information (mindmaps, outlines, or tedegraphs :-) This is a poor quick implementation of application making tedegraph from Wikipedia article in Python3 and PyQt5. The format could be used for information exchange in the future. When we read something our concentration is better with the picture (because picture is worth thousand words). Picture or other graphical information piece is the core of information which is described by sentences which are played one by one. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BijgqxztEpg
